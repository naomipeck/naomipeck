# Data Management Plans

???

This walkthrough is largely based on Kung (2019, 2022).

# What is a DMP? (Mattern 2022, Kung 2022)

Data Management Plans (DMPs) are "living documents" which should be created early on within a project.

DMPs generally include:

- a description of the data that will be collected

- how the data will be compiled and analysed

- metadata and documentation of what will be produced

- the ways the data will be stored and backed up

- security and privacy protections for data

- data access policies during a project

- a long-term plan for data sharing and preservation

# Data Generation and Analysis

1. What kind of data will your project produce?

    a. What type, format, and amount of digital data will you produce?

    b. Will you be creating any analog data? If so, what kind?

    c. Will the analog data be digitized? When? In what format(s)?

    d. Will you reuse existing data? If so, describe those data and their source(s).

1. What best practices for data collection/generation (relevant to your sub-discipline and the data types) will you follow for collecting the data?

1. What equipment, software and/or other tools will you use to generate and analyze the data?

1. Will any of the data need to be kept private, confidential, or restricted? If so, explain why and how that will be accomplished.

---

# Data Handling

1. How will you differentiate raw data from working data files?

1. How will you manage file versioning?

1. Will you need to implement any kind of quality assurance or quality control protocols for generating or handling the data? If so, describe them.

1. Will you use any research management tool(s) or software?

1. Will anyone besides you be generating or handling the data? If so,

    a. Who are the team members?
    
    b. What roles will they play in the research?

# Copyright and Data

#### Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. 

#### Different countries follow different copyright laws and you should always make sure to doublecheck what applies to your situation. This advice is primarily intended for those in the EU (specifically Germany).

--

In Germany, you automatically have rights as an author to your work through its creation and do not need to register it. These rights can only be transferred to a third party through inheritance.

Anyone who you record also obtains rights to the recording under German copyright law as either an author or as a performer. The Copyright Act protects their moral rights and allows them to prohibit any derogatory treatment which would endanger their standing.

There is no doctrine of "Fair Use/Handling" or "Work Made for Hire" in Germany, like there is in many Anglosphere countries. Lawfully permitted uses are instead outlined in the UrhG, which includes scientific research.

???

People involved in the data collection process should understand their rights before recording. This should ideally form part of your informed consent process.

Act on Copyright and Related Rights (Urheberrechtsgesetz - UrhG) https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_urhg/index.html

Copyright Act of 9 September 1965 (Federal Law Gazette I, p. 1273), as last amended by Article 1 of the Act of 28 November 2018 (Federal Law Gazette I, p. 2014)

# Copyright and Data

If you create a database in the EU (such as a collection of your data), you also have *sui generis* rights under the Database Directive. These rights last for 15 years from the publication or "completion" of your database, and is renewed upon a substantial addition/alteration of the database.

???

Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31996L0009

# What is legally possible may not be ethically right.

---

# Privacy of Data

In the EU, we are required to abide by the GDPR. This means we must be careful when dealing with personal data, which inevitably impacts how we go about data collection. Even anonymising counts as processing personal data.

Unfortunately for us, recording audiovisual data is something we cannot anonymise.

As such, it is incredibly important to collect the explicit consent of those who you work with.

--

You may end up collecting sensitive data during fieldwork. Sensitive data is defined as:

&gt; ‚Äúpersonal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation‚Äù

You need to be especially careful when dealing with this type of data and should consider the potential risks to those being recorded when publishing such data.

???

REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02016R0679-20160504

---

# Privacy of Data: Some tips

1. Be fair and transparent about your research.

1. Different countries have different ethical and legal requirements for conducting fieldwork. You should make sure to abide by ethical and legal standards both at your home institution and in your field community.

1. You can take informed consent in writing or orally. This will largely depend on who you are working with, and where. All forms of taking informed consent should be done in clear and simple language.

1. Make sure to say how personal data will be processed and how long it will be stored for, as well as which purposes the personal data will be used for.

1. Consent is not explicitly required under the GDPR for archiving or scientific research. However, it is ethically wrong to archive recordings of people without their consent.

1. Consult the Data Protection Officer at your university if you may end up collecting sensitive data.

# Data Storage, Backup, and Security

---

# Back-ups

## 3-2-1 Rule

**3** copies of data on **2** storage media with **1** copy in an off-site location

## LOCKSS

**L**ots of **C**opies **K**eep **S**tuff **S**afe

## Check your back-ups

Even if you have your data backed-up, it is always possible that something could happen to it. Your portable HD could become corrupted or you could have your apartment burn down (true story). Make sure to regularly evaluate if everything works!

---

# Data Storage

3. How will you store and back up your data during data collection and analysis?

    a. Will you be using a data storage service (e.g., IT-managed storage, cloud storage)?
    
    b. Who will be responsible for backing up the data? You? A data storage service?
    
    c. How often will the data be backed up?

3. How will you keep raw data separate from working data?

3. How/when will you migrate your data?

3. How will analog data be stored and backed up?

3. If you will be generating data at a field site, how will you safely and securely transfer it to your office/home?

---

# Data Backup

3. How much data will you need to store? 

    a. Estimate of the amount of anticipated data in GB or TB.
    
    b. For projects that also require audio and video data, estimate the number of recording hours for each format.

3. What are the costs associated with storage and backup?

3. How will you keep your data secure?

    a. Who will have access to the data and how will they be given access?
    
    b. How will personal information about research participants be protected?

# What naming scheme will we use?

???

Things to keep in mind:
- filenames must be unique
- sessions should share the same filename
- filenaming for one data collection purpose may not be relevant for another purpose

# Metadata

Sullivant (2020) classifies metadata for descriptions of archival collections into three different priority levels. A pared down version can be found in the link in Shared Notes.

Skim through the information in light of what else you've learnt about metadata today. How does this list differ from the types of metadata that we have discussed so far?

<div class="countdown" id="timer_61f53dc4" style="right:0;bottom:0;" data-warnwhen="0">

# Disseminating and Sharing Data

5. How will you license the data for reuse?

5. If relevant, how will the data be shared with or repatriated to the speech community?

5. What, if any, special protocols or rules (Indigenous or Traditional Knowledge) will apply to the data?

    a. How will those protocols be implemented in the chosen archive?

5. How will you disseminate and share data from your project?

5. What portion of the data must be archived?

5. Will a portion of the data have to be deleted or destroyed?

5. Will a portion of the data need to be anonymized or de-identified?

As a group, choose an archive from the previous list, and answer the following questions:

1. Who has access to this digital repository?

1. What types of files does the archive accept?

1. What metadata is required by the archive?

1. What are the potential costs associated with archiving and long-term preservation of data?

1. What levels of access to the data are possible?

1. How does the speech community influence the archival process?
