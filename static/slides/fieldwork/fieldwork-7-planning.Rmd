# Planning a Session

Having a plan of what to do before working with your consultants is invaluable. It helps you think through what data you need to test and collect, making the time you spend together more worthwhile.

Plans can also help you if you do not have any idea of what to do. Having a few 'back-up' sessions planned, e.g., collecting word lists or topics for an interview, means that you always have something to fall back upon if you do not have any other hypotheses to test.

Fieldwork requires us to be flexible. It doesn't mean that we can't be prepared.

# Template for Descriptive Fieldwork

.pull-left[
Kristian Roncero has published a [pretty nice template](https://zenodo.org/record/3835660#.YfaF8v7MKUk) for fieldwork sessions involving language documentation and description.

The template is split into three different sections and should be filled out digitally. The first section (pictured) involves planning your session.

Session 2 involves some self-reflection as a researcher as well as notes which could be relevant for metadata/documentation purposes. Section 3 requires you to process the notes which accompany your session.

Kristian also wrote a blog (https://elararchive.org/blog/2020/07/17/fieldwork-session-planner/) explaining some of his thinking behind his template. I highly recommend taking a look!

# Planning a Sociolinguistic Interview

To conduct a sociolinguistic interview, you should construct "modules" of questions around a single topic. These should start with exploratory questions to establish whether an interlocutor is interested in the topic or not. If yes, then you should continue with the module; if not, then move on to the next potential topic of interest.

Topics which intimately involve speakers are best, such as family stories or childhood memories. These topics should be tailored to the speech community and move from more general topics to something which can elicit a personal experience or memory. Make judicious use of add-ons and follow-up questions if you get the chance as well!

Use open questions where possible. Some times closed (yes/no) questions are unavoidable, but then you should follow them up with an open question directly after. Additionally, keep questions impersonal and avoid value judgements. This could be done by speaking about third parties, for example, and then asking after the speaker's opinion.

Some example modules can be found [here](http://www.nytud.hu/buszi/wp4/node4.html), [here](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~wlabov/L470/Labov1984.pdf), and [here](https://depts.washington.edu/sociolab/researchtools/elicitation/documents/wassinkPNWE2.php).

Massive thanks to Miriam Neuhausen for teaching me a lot about how sociolinguists conduct fieldwork. A lot of the material you see here is thanks to her; all misunderstandings are my own!

# During the Session

You should always take notes during your sessions! 

It is best to do this with pen and paper to avoid capturing the noise of typing during a recording.

Remember to revisit your notes after the recording and reflect, as Kristian's template encourages.

--

When you make your recording for tomorrow, why not try out using one of these ideas to plan your session?

Regardless of whether you use a template or not, you should have a clear idea of what you want to record before starting.
