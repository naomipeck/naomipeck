The interviewer and recorder are reading a brief introduction to the task.

Your "recording" will begin when the interviewer shares their screen and the recorder "starts" the "recording".

# Interviewer (1/2)

### Background Information (taken from official instructions)

This resource has been created as an elicitation stimulus with similar aims to the “family problems” task used by the Social Cognition research group. That is, to record rich data about a wide range of categories relevant to psycho-social cognition.

The task consists of 9 images telling the story of the jackal and the crow. 

The points of interest for social cognition are where the protagonists are motivated by their own thoughts and the suggestions and actions of others to do things, or feel things.

# Interviewer (2/2)

### Instructions

Basic Set-up (Set-up A)

It is explained to the participant that they are going to tell a story using the picture cards. The cards are given to the participant one at a time. If the participant has been unsure of the story until the end you may wish to ask them to retell it when they have all the cards.

Wordings for suggested instructions are as follows:

1. Individual card descriptions
*‘I have some pictures here that tell a story. I’m going to show you the pictures, one at a time, and I want you to tell me the story.'*

2. Retelling, if necessary
*‘Now we've seen all the pictures I would like you to tell me the whole story together.’*

When you are ready, move to the next slide and share your screen. The recorder will "start" the recording and you can begin.

# Recorder (2/2)

If the interviewer is still reading when you reach this slide, please check the microphone level of the interviewee.

When the interviewer has understood the task, they will share their screen with the breakout room. At this point, if you have not done so, please check levels. 

You may now "start" the "recording" by clapping and saying the basic metadata. At no point you should give information into the background of the task. The interviewer will take over from there.

The task should take approximately 10 minutes. Feel free to take notes during the "recording". At the end of the task, briefly summarise what happened (10 seconds or less) and thank the interviewee for their time.

# Interviewer (2/2)

### Instructions

You will be eliciting 50 words from your interviewee. 

Before starting, explain to your interviewee the format of the activity.

Ask them how they would say each word in their mother tongue (feel free to use gestures to help).

Get the interviewee to repeat each word once in isolation, then once in a frame sentence.

If you are using English as the contact language and German as the target language, you can use the frame sentence:
*Ich habe ___ gesagt.*

When you are ready, ask the recorder to "start recording". Move to the next slide to see the words you need to elicit.
