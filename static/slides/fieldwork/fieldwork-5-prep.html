# Content Warning

This session deals with some heavy topics later around difficulties in going to the field. These issues are very real and you should be aware of them before deciding to conduct fieldwork.

That said, if you need to give this session a miss for whatever reason, it is more than okay. Come back later to join us for elicitation!

&gt; #### *Fieldwork is a drug. Walking into people's lives is just fabulous, you know? It's something we get to do and most people don't. ... But you know when I go there all my troubles disappear, you know? You're just completely taken up in these other people's lives and suddenly your crap seems like nothing. So, it's a drug.*

# What do I need before going to the field?

---

# A plan for data collection

Before going, you should have your metadata protocols and equipment all sorted out. You should also have a good idea of what data you want to collect, and whether you need to bring any materials for this purpose (e.g. specialised equipment, props for elicitation).

One thing which you may not have considered is what language to do elicitation in. Your elicitation could be monolingual, or you may need to communicate through a lingua franca or contact language. This may require you to learn a completely different language in order to do fieldwork in your desired part of the world. You should aim to achieve communicative competence in the language you are doing fieldwork in where possible.

&gt;####*The majority of [Minderico] speakers are active speakers but they could switch all the time. So, if I use Portuguese they will continue in Portuguese straight away, they don’t switch to Minderico again. I was working with the language already before, so in order to conduct the interviews and all the elicitation and everything, I had to use Minderico because I knew if I start with Portuguese they will switch immediately to Portuguese and will not go back to Minderico.*

# Knowledge about the situation

Forewarned is forearmed!

There are many, many works out there which can help us prepare for the linguistic and cultural situation into which we are entering. Earlier descriptions of the language, descriptions of related languages or languages spoken in the area, as well as ethnographic, cultural, and historic information of the community are tremendously helpful in getting situated in a speech community.

Having contacts within the community can be incredibly helpful in this case. You can enter a community as a "friend of a friend" and gain access to many more people than you would alone. They can also guide you through early days in a community and help you from committing any *faux pas* from ignorance. Make sure you listen to your friends in the community -- they know what is going on.

Ideally, you will have also familiarised yourself with relevant linguistic questions and theories which may be interesting for you. This could be phonetic features to look out for or typological questionnaires to answer. These theories can help guide you in data collection.

&gt; ####*While staying at my field site in Ethiopia for the first time, I was not aware that it was inappropriate to look into men’s eyes and to display a too cheerful behaviour when speaking with them, because this was easily interpreted as a pick-up attempt. As a severe consequence of this, a man entered my hotel room uninvited and he could only be made to leave with very harsh words.*

# Knowledge about fieldwork

No-one should go into the field without talking to a fieldworker or reading about experiences in the field.

Fieldwork can be a mentally tiring activity. You are often away from family and friends and must deal with living somewhere new in a different cultural environment. Sometimes, fieldwork can take you to remote areas without electricity or phone service, let alone any internet signal! The food can be very different to what you're used to, and you may have to eat foods that you would never eat otherwise to be polite. 

You are often not in control of your life and your data collection process in a way you'd like. However, working with speakers to collect and analyse data is a rewarding process that is hard to replicate elsewhere. Let yourself be guided but try to achieve your goals the best you can.

&gt; ####*I like to read personal accounts of other fieldworkers while in the village. Life in the field was so different at first that I suffered from culture shock and thought the whole village was crazy. Reading how other researchers work in similar environments and cope with it changed my perception of my own situation. I had been like a soccer player on a rugby field, complaining that the locals constantly broke the rules; but they simply had different rules. I had to discover and accept that my behavioural norms were not applicable in their society.*

# Travel plans

- travel arrangements

    - you may need to apply months in advance for research permits and visas
    
    - make sure your passport has enough validity if you travel overseas!
    
    - consulting a doctor (e.g. you may need additional vaccinations)

- obtaining research clearance

    - should be on good terms with authorities in the area
    
    - consider partnering with nearby universities
    
    - getting funding for field trips can be a long endeavour

---

# Living in the Field
    
- finding accommodation or lodging

    - consider whether you should live on site or not
    
    - consider what your presence somewhere would mean materially for a host family
    
    - what medical supplies should you bring along?
    
    - how will you access money in the field? how can you keep this safe?

- plans in case of emergency

- privacy

- diet

&gt;####*...I didn’t realize in Amami there is only one day a year where you can get rid of your batteries, where you can recycle them. That one day in the year was not while I was there, so I had to give them to someone to save for six more months until that day came.*

# Self-care

- taking time off work when possible

    - sometimes this feels impossible
    
    - going on walks/runs when possible
    
    - bringing some reading material
    
    - sometimes you don't have the privacy
    
    - write a journal

&gt; ####*And you’ve got to look after yourself as well, and I think that’s also really important, and that’s the same if you’re doing this kind of work here. Right? Like if you’re stressed, if you’re unwell, if you’re not looking after yourself, it just gets harder and harder. So I think sort of being led by your own interests and curiosity, being patient and kind of taking a broad kind of holistic view, if you want, and then, yeah, self-care. And I think that’s probably true for many of the things we do in this world as well, but just like looking after yourself, because, yeah, if you’re not sort of approaching it 100%, then yeah, it’s really difficult to keep going.*

# Working with consultants

    - ethics clearance from home university where applicable

    - depends on field site

- finding consultants

    - should you pay or not?
    
        - if so, what are appropriate wages?
        
    - what can you give back to those who help you?
    
    - what aptitude/talent does a consultant have?
    
    - patience is golden
    
    - back up plans

&gt; ####*One of the saddest deaths was of a young woman whose mother was a great help to my work. She was about 22 I think, and had been sick for years, but she had improved and so I was hoping when I went back to the village to find her in the pink of health. The day I arrived in the village I was told that she had died the day before. There would be a ceremony on the 7th day after she died, and if I could attend it would be a great merit for her, I was told. So of course I changed my plans so I could be there. A year or two earlier, her mother had asked for a silk hat from Thailand as a gift, so I got one, but not being a fashion person it was too big. Still she loved it and I took a photo of her wearing it. This was the picture they used at her funeral.*

&gt; ####*Doing interviews alone is pretty- it's a pretty harsh emotional experience 'cause you get rejected a lot and there are a lot of suspicions you know people think you're selling tape recorders and... So, I can remember sitting in my room and crying because it was so- Sali: Traumatic. Walt: Yeah. Being rejected and sort of feeling totally alone and sort of, "I got to get this stuff. I got to get this data," you know?*

# Slogans for Fieldwork (Rice 2001:230)

Pay careful attention to information about the language that the speaker you are working with wants you to hear.

Know the available literature and respect it, but keep in mind that there is always more to learn.

Avoid isolating areas of the language so that you lose track of the fact that language is a complex, dynamic system.

Bring as much knowledge as you can, from all domains – about language, about linguistics, about people.

Do not straightjacket the language into categories that you bring to it – let it live on its own.

# Slogans for Fieldwork (Rice 2001:230)

Do not think that language is a monolithic entity within a community. There is variation within language, and this must be part of any analysis.

Not all speakers have the same strengths.

A good working relationship is an evolving thing. Both speakers and the linguist must get to know one another.

Be open to learn.

# On a more serious and personal note

No-one's fieldwork experience is ever "perfect", no matter how much we glorify "the field" in academia. Only go into the field when you are prepared for a very intense experience.

&gt; ####*Fieldwork takes me completely outside of myself and this can be quite shattering. What keeps me going back is the fact that there is simply nothing like the feeling that comes from being an outsider who is recognised, accepted and welcomed into a family or a community. I have learnt a lot about myself by discovering what other people can see in me. Without becoming vulnerable and dependent, there is no opportunity for others to provide the warmth and hospitality that they can extend so generously when they recognise the need. So, in spite of the difficulties and ambivalence, there is nothing in my field experience that I would ever give back and I will certainly be going again (and again).*
