# Homework

For tomorrow's session, you will need an audio(visual) recording 3-5 minutes in length. You are more than welcome to record something longer, but you will likely not be able to finish its annotation tomorrow.

This recording should be in a language which you are comfortable transcribing and analysing, such as German or English.

I recommend you make a recording of a friend or family member, but you can also choose to record yourself.
