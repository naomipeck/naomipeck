# Interviewer (1/2)

### Background Information

A six-minute film that was produced at the University of California at Berkeley in 1975 and shown to speakers of a number of languages, who were asked to tell what happened in it. In the meantime it has been used in a variety of other studies across other languages. The goal has been to present cinematically a series of more or less natural events to multiple viewers, who are then asked to verbalize what they remember.

We will be doing a twist on this today, where we look at on-line processing.

# Interviewer (2/2)

### Set-up

You will explain to the participant that they are going to watch a video. The participant should narrate the video out loud while they watch it in a language they are comfortable in.

Wordings for suggested instructions are as follows:

*‘I am about to show you a video that tells a story. I want you to tell me what's happening as you see it in the video.'*

When you are ready, move to the next slide and share your screen. The recorder will "start" the recording and you can begin.

# Recorder (2/2)

### Set-up

If the interviewer is still reading when you reach this slide, please check the microphone level of the interviewee.

When the interviewer has understood the task, they will share their screen with the breakout room. At this point, if you have not done so, please check levels. 

You may now "start" the "recording" by clapping and saying the basic metadata. At no point you should give information into the background of the task. The interviewer will take over from there.

The task should take approximately 10 minutes. Feel free to take notes during the "recording". At the end of the task, briefly summarise what happened (10 seconds or less) and thank the interviewee for their time.

# Interviewee (1/1)

# Interviewer (1/2)

### Background Information (taken from official instructions)

The task consists of 9 images telling the story of the jackal and the crow.

# Interviewer (2/2)

### Instructions

Basic Set-up (Set-up A)

It is explained to the participant that they are going to tell a story using the picture cards. The cards are given to the participant one at a time. If the participant has been unsure of the story until the end you may wish to ask them to retell it when they have all the cards.

Wordings for suggested instructions are as follows:

1. Individual card descriptions
*‘I have some pictures here that tell a story. I’m going to show you the pictures, one at a time, and I want you to tell me the story.'*

2. Retelling, if necessary
*‘Now we've seen all the pictures I would like you to tell me the whole story together.’*

When you are ready, move to the next slide and share your screen. The recorder will "start" the recording and you can begin.

### Instructions

You will be eliciting 50 words from your interviewee. 

Before starting, explain to your interviewee the format of the activity.

Ask them how they would say each word in their mother tongue (feel free to use gestures to help).

Get the interviewee to repeat each word once in isolation, then once in a frame sentence.

If you are using English as the contact language and German as the target language, you can use the frame sentence:
*Ich habe ___ gesagt.*
