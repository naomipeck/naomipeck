# Data Management Plans

# What is a DMP? (Mattern 2022, Kung 2022)

Data Management Plans (DMPs) are "living documents" which should be created early on within a project.

DMPs generally include:

- a description of the data that will be collected

- how the data will be compiled and analysed

- metadata and documentation of what will be produced

- the ways the data will be stored and backed up

- security and privacy protections for data

- data access policies during a project

- a long-term plan for data sharing and preservation

# Please open the DMP Outline (link in the Shared Notes). 

I have already filled in some (more boring) sections of the DMP.

Throughout the rest of the session, we will regularly gather in breakout rooms to discuss various points we need to address in the DMP. During these sessions, please take notes using your group's dedicated document. 

At the end of the session, we will discuss these as a larger group and finalise our group DMP.

# Data Generation, Analysis and Handling

In groups, discuss the following:

1. What type of data will we produce 'in the field'?

1. What format should this be created and stored in?

1. Will we make any analog data? If so, how should we digitise this?

1. What equipment, software and/or other tools do we need to generate the data?

1. What equipment, software and/or other tools do we need to analyse the data?

## Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. 

### Different countries follow different copyright laws and you should always make sure to doublecheck what applies to your situation. This advice is primarily intended for those in the EU (specifically Germany).

# Copyright and Data

In Germany, you automatically have rights as an author to your work through its creation and do not need to register it. This includes right of reproduction, distribution, and use, and various moral rights. These rights can only be transferred to a third party through inheritance. Copyright lasts your lifetime + 70 years. 

Anyone who you record also obtains joint rights to the recording under German copyright law as either an author or as a performer. People involved in the data collection process should understand their rights before recording. This should ideally form part of your informed consent process.

???

Act on Copyright and Related Rights (Urheberrechtsgesetz - UrhG) https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_urhg/index.html

Copyright Act of 9 September 1965 (Federal Law Gazette I, p. 1273), as last amended by Article 1 of the Act of 28 November 2018 (Federal Law Gazette I, p. 2014)

There is no doctrine of "Fair Use/Handling" or "Work Made for Hire" in Germany, like there is in many Anglosphere countries. Lawfully permitted uses are instead outlined in the UrhG, which includes scientific research.

--

If you create a database in the EU (such as a collection of your data), you also have *sui generis* rights under the Database Directive. These rights last for 15 years from the publication or "completion" of your database, and is renewed upon a substantial addition/alteration of the database.

# What is legally possible may not be ethically right.

# Privacy of Data

In the EU, we are required to abide by the GDPR. This means we must be careful when dealing with personal data, which inevitably impacts how we go about data collection. Even anonymising counts as processing personal data.

Unfortunately for us, recording audiovisual data is something we rarely anonymise.

As such, it is incredibly important to collect the explicit consent of those who you work with when applicable.

--

You may end up collecting sensitive data during fieldwork. Sensitive data is defined as:

> *“personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation”*

You need to be especially careful when dealing with this type of data and should consider the potential risks to those being recorded when publishing such data.

???

Consult the Data Protection Officer at your university if you think you may collect sensitive data.

---

# Privacy of Data: Some tips

1. Be fair and transparent about your research.

1. Be mindful of power differences. Make sure that any consent is collected voluntarily.

1. Different countries have different ethical and legal requirements for conducting fieldwork. You should make sure to abide by ethical and legal standards both at your home institution and in your field community.

1. Informed consent can be oral or written, depending on what is most appropriate. 

1. All forms of taking informed consent should be done in clear and simple language.

1. Make sure to say how personal data will be processed and how long it will be stored for, as well as which purposes the personal data will and will not be used for.

1. Consent is not explicitly required under the GDPR for archiving or scientific research. However, it is ethically wrong to archive recordings of people without their consent.

# Legalities and Ethics

1. Take a look at the [Traditional Knowledge Labels](https://localcontexts.org/labels/traditional-knowledge-labels/). Would any of these apply to our data?

1. Will any of the data we collect need to be kept private, confidential, or restricted? Why?

1. One of the *R*-words is reciprocity. How can we give back to those who help us collect data?

1. How can we balance open access principles with legal and ethical concerns?

# Data Storage, Backup, and Security

---

# Back-ups

With larger documentation projects, the space required for back-up can rack up quickly. For example, the size of a 10 minute recording can differ radically between formats. A lossy .mp3 is only 5MB, but a lossless .wav is 50MB and lossy SD .mpg is 100MB. Good quality data is an investment in more than one sense.

--

### Regularly check your back-ups!

Even if you have your data backed-up, it is always possible that something could happen to it. Your portable HD could become corrupted or you could have your apartment burn down (true story). Make sure to regularly evaluate if everything works!

---

# Backing-up in the field

When you're at a remote field site, making sure your data is safe and secure can be very difficult. 

Make sure to take extra hard drives, memory cards, and potentially even a CD writer and empty CDs. You should also have waterproof bags to keep them safe!

Many fieldworkers will try to back their data up on an online cloud-service if they have access, but you should be careful that the service you use complies with GDPR. In other places, the internet access is too spotty or slow for this to work.

---

# Back-ups

## 3-2-1 Rule

**3** copies of data on **2** storage media with **1** copy in an off-site location

## LOCKSS

**L**ots of **C**opies **K**eep **S**tuff **S**afe

---

# Data Storage and Security

Take a look at the [information sheet](https://sustainableheritagenetwork.org/system/files/atoms/file/EstimatingStorageRequiredForAudio.pdf) from The Sustainable Heritage Network.

Your homework today will be to make a 3-5 minute long recording. Assuming that everyone makes a 5 minute stereo .wav recording with 16-bit depth and 44.1 kHz sampling rate, how big would our collection be? How big would our collection be if we each recorded an hour?

Now take a look at the [Calculation model for costs of (digital) storage](https://zenodo.org/record/4033087#.YfWS_f7MKUk) from Rob Hooft. How much would it cost us to host the small repository for 10 years? What about the large one for 70 years? Make sure to select the appropriate options for our data.

What metadata do they require on an item level? What metadata do they require on a session level?

What information do you think we should minimally include in the metadata for our collection?
