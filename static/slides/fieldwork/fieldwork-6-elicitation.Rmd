# Observer's Paradox

> #### To obtain the data most important for linguistic theory, we have to observe how people speak when they are not being observed. <br><br> (Labov 1972:113)

???

Labov, William. 1972. Some principles of linguistic methodology. *Language in Society* 1, 97-120.

--

To get around the observer's paradox, aim to ask questions which prompt unreserved reactions or engage your consultants in the data collection process, so they become collaborators rather than 'lab rats'.

--

Do not go out and just try to get people to say "fourth floor"!

---

# Discussion

We have only discussed ethics around the overall data collection process. What kind of ethical concerns should we be aware of when working directly with speakers?

<!-- insert clock -->

???

ethics of speakers may be different, power dynamics of researcher and consultants, different relationship to language than Westerners; respect between consultants and researcher is paramount; respect each others time; respect the effort given

# Elicitation Techniques

# Translation: Word Lists

Collecting word lists is one of the first thing any descriptive linguist does in the field. It helps us figure out what kind of sound system we're dealing with and basic syntactic information, while helping us compile a lexical database.

It is very simple: you ask a consultant "how would you say/sign X in your language?"

--

**Bonus**: Be flexible! Let your consultant tell you related words. Perhaps you'll find out about something culturally important you can ask about later?

---

# Tips for Word Lists

To get consistent phonetic data, you should also formulate some frame sentences. 

The ideal frame sentence is one where the target word is utterance-medial and surrounded by voiceless stops. If you can't get voiceless stops, then get voiced stops. The next best thing would be a nasal or a low vowel.  If you are working with a tonal language, make sure to take this into account too.

# Examples of Word Lists

Word lists can be general, comparative, or domain-specific. Here are some examples you can refer to:

# Translation: Linguistic Structure

It is also possible to use the translation technique to get some initial insights into linguistic structures. This could involve testing phonotactics or grammatical structures.

**Phonotactics**: "Is there a word like *snaf* in your language?"

**Grammar**: "What would you say if there was more than one *snaf*?" "Could you say *snafs*?"

Sometimes you end up discovering words that you would have never thought of asking for beforehand with this technique!

--

You do have to be careful, however, of any kind of transfer or priming. This technique works best for simple phenomena and does not work well if you are looking for more unusual or pragmatically marked phenomena.

# Translation: Text Translation

After you have collected a text, you can work with speakers/signers of a language to work on transcribing and translating a text.

# Sociolinguistic Interview

The sociolinguistic interview is a technique used to mitigate observer effects by posing the interviewer as an interested interlocutor or friend. 

The recordings are overt but topics are general and interviewees are encouraged to talk as freely as possible. This results in relatively high quality conversational data.

This technique works best in a monolingual format; consider enlisting the help or training a native speaker interviewer if needed in the field.

Massive thanks to Miriam Neuhausen for teaching me a lot about how sociolinguists conduct fieldwork! A lot of the material you see here is thanks to her; all misunderstandings are my own!

# Conducting a Sociolinguistic Interview

Begin with talking about social factors you need for your data analysis: "Where were you born?" "What year were you born in?"

--

Think about what topics you may want information around. Structure your interview from more general impersonal questions and then move to more specific personal questions.

Ask a few general questions: "Do you remember your first day at school?" "What was your favourite subject?"

Move on to more personal questions: "Did something ever happen on the way to school?" "Did the teacher ever punish you for something you didn't do?"

--

Finally, if you wish, you can ask language-related questions: "How did the children from X speak? How was it different to how you speak?"

You can also administer a word list or reading exercise to elicit target forms.

This portion of the interview reflects a more self-conscious style, as attention is drawn to the language of the interviewee.

# Grammatical Judgements

These are perhaps better termed *acceptability* judgements, as any judgement necessarily involves pragmatic acceptability.

--

This type of data is similar to introspection, in that it is highly dependent on a speaker's opinion. That said, it is incredibly valuable in collecting *negative* data, i.e. what *cannot* be said. You should simply be  careful in the interpretation of the data.

---

# Collecting Grammatical Judgements

Start with a hypothesis about a given language structure: "is there a structural difference between pronominal *what* and adjectival *which*?"

Construct multiple sentences to test this hypothesis:

1. "What did you claim that John bought?" "Which book did you claim that John bought?"

1. "What did you make the claim that John bought?" "Which book did you make the claim that John bought?"

Ask your consultant which feels more natural to say.

See if you can substitute words in the sentences and for them to still be grammatical/acceptable.

--

**Bonus**: Ask your consultant about other ways they could say the same thing. 

--

**Bonus**: Ask if a different phrasing means something different or would be used in a different context.

# Grammatical Judgements

Here are some suggestions of things you could elicit or test using this technique:

- grammatical paradigms

- scope of operators

- tense and aspect

# Tips for Grammatical Judgements

Be very careful about how you elicit this data - asking for multiple grammatical judgements in a row often leads to confusion or fatigue. This can result in a consultant trying to give you the answer you want in an effort to finish as quickly as possible!

Beware of syntactic priming! It is best to try and get this data multiple times from the same person or different people to try and mitigate effects the fieldworker may have had on the data.

If doing language description, there are a lot of typological questionnaires out there which can give you advice on which grammatical features to try to elicit. A classic is Comrie and Smith 1977.

Grammatical judgements do not give you information about the frequency of a construction or when the construction would be acceptable. Consider complementing this data with corpus work.

# Text Elicitation

More naturalistic data can be collected if you ask a speaker to tell a story. This can be useful for finding structures you may not have otherwise found through questionnaire-based techniques, which can then be used for further testing.

# Genres of Narrative

- Personal narratives: "Could you tell me about yourself?" "Tell me about a recent hunting trip."

- Historical narratives: "

- Folktales: "Do you know a story about the boogeyman?"

- Procedural texts: "Can you tell me how to weave a basket?"

# Tips for better recordings

1. Record for your future self listening back to the track, not for the you now!

1. Turn off electrical equipment in the area which contributes to underlying noise.

1. Record in areas without wind and use a windscreen (sometimes called a "dead cat"!).

1. Record in areas which will not 'reflect' sound. You can dampen echoes by using lots of textiles!

1. Avoid creating extra noises when recording, such as typing or clicking a pen.

1. Monitor the recording through a pair of headphones throughout the recording or have a separate person fulfil this role.

1. Find better times to record if it is too noisy.

---

# Tips for better recordings

1. Make sure your microphone is steady and will not move around. Consider using a tripod or mount if needed.

1. Use an external microphone: these provide much better quality audio than in-built microphones. 

1. The shorter the cord connecting the microphone to the recorder, the better.

1. Use an appropriate microphone. Unidirectional microphones (cardioid; shotgun) are good for capturing the audio of single speakers; omni- or bidirectional microphones are good for when multiple people are present.

1. Adjust your microphone placement properly so that any unidirectional microphones are pointed (roughly) at the bottom lip of a speaker. This should avoid capturing pops created by plosives.

1. Aim to keep audio recording gain at maximum -3~-6dB. Clipping occurs at 0dB.

---

# Best recording practice

- Test your sound levels before starting and adjust them as needed.

- Always doublecheck you are recording before you start.

- Make a sharp, loud noise (e.g. a clap) in front of the microphone to indicate the start of a recording. This is incredibly helpful for syncing multiple audiovisual streams.

- Briefly list relevant metadata at the start of the recording (e.g., purpose of recording, who is recording, who will be speaking/signing, date of recording, location).

- Continue monitoring your sound quality throughout the recording.

- Prompt your speaker/signer, but do not interrupt them. You want to collect their data, not yours!

- Briefly summarise your session or get your speaker to do so before ending your recording.

- Fill out your metadata and backup and rename your files as soon as possible after sessions.
