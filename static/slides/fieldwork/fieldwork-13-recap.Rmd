# Recap

We are now coming to the end of the workshop. Every good field trip needs a debrief afterwards, so let's go over again what you've learnt over the past two days.

--

#### You've learnt what fieldwork is all about the social connections, rather than going somewhere exotic.

--

#### You've learnt about different types of data and how to think critically about what you collect and create.

--

#### You've learnt about how to make data management a part of your fieldwork plan, rather than an afterthought. You even helped to make one!

--

#### You've learnt that planning can only take you so far and that flexibility is key.

--

#### You've learnt about different ways to ethically collect data from and with others.

---

# Recap


#### You've learnt best practices about recording and how to save your future self from pain when listening back.

--

#### You've made a recording yourself using what you've learned!

--

#### You've followed your data management plan in processing this data.

--

#### You've learnt about what kinds of problems you need to think about during data processing and analysis.
