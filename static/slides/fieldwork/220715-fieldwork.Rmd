# Hi!

.pull-left[
My name is Naomi Peck and I am a PhD student at the University of Freiburg, Germany.

I am writing my dissertation on the interaction of prosody, morphosyntactic structure, and information packaging in three languages of Arunachal Pradesh, India.

Pre-COVID, I was planning to write a descriptive grammar of Kera'a, one of the languages I use in my thesis.

# Hi!

I have previously conducted two trips to the field (Dibang Valley and Lower Dibang Valley, India) and worked with a consultant of a different language at my previous university for approximately 3 years. I also just taught a Field Methods class on Ndebele, a Bantu language, with Kirsten Culhane. <br><br>

What you'll learn today *is not* everything there is to fieldwork. However, you should come away with ideas about how to get started with planning a fieldtrip, no matter whether this be in a different country or in the next village over.

# Who fieldwork?

Minimally two people:

However, it tends to involve many, many more!

???

Who else participates in the process of fieldwork?

--

- lots more people who are happy to help out (or get paid) for data collection

- separate person doing the recordings

- separate interviewer

- translators

- transcribers

- funding bodies and other authorities

- the wider speech community

# Why do fieldwork?

# Why fieldwork?

Himmelmann 2006 argues for three main reasons for language documentation:

1. capture endangered languages

1. building up research resources for the future

1. ensure robust linguistic analyses

???

--

To this, we can add some other reasons why people do fieldwork:

1. religious reasons

1. language revival

1. theoretical research

1. comparative research

1. variationist research

# When fieldwork?

This really depends on a number of factors, such as the field site, researcher availability, funding issues and much much more.

In short: any time!

class: middle

# But first:

### Let's brainstorm what we might have to keep in mind when going to the field.

---

# Going to the field

There are a number of people involved in the fieldwork process, each with different stakes in the research process.

Over the next five minutes, each of you will take on a role of one group involved in fieldwork and brainstorm potential issues that might be important for your 'stakeholder' group.

1. Researcher going to the field
1. Community members
1. Archivist/librarian
1. Funding body (university, grant giver etc.)

Afterwards, we will collate the ideas on a digital whiteboard and have a general discussion about what this means for how to do fieldwork.

# What should we take into account when we collect data?

???

Write in the chat ideas about what things need to be collected!

---

# Primary Data

Primary data is directly generated in the process of fieldwork. <br><br>

--

There are three main types of primary data: <br><br>

--

1. Introspective <br><br>

???

e.g. grammaticality judgment

--

2. Elicited <br><br>

???

e.g. direct translations; recordings

--

3. Observed

???

e.g. natural conversation; e.g. field notes

---

# Primary Data

These data differ according to different parameters: <br><br>

--

1. naturalistic vs. controlled <br><br>

--

2. spontaneous vs. elicited <br><br>

--

3. audiovisual vs. written

---

# Secondary Data

Secondary data involves a level of abstraction away from primary data sources. <br><br>

--

1. Annotations (of multiple levels and formats) <br><br>

--

2. Structural analyses (syntagmatic/paradigmatic)<br><br>

--

3. Lexical data (including dictionaries)

---

# Tertiary Data

Tertiary data involves another level of abstraction from secondary data.

---

# Tertiary Data

```{r, label="wals-map", out.width='100%', fig.height=6, echo=FALSE}

#str(df)
wals <- df[,c(2:6)]
#str(wals)
wals$value <- as.factor(wals$value)
wals$description <- as.factor(wals$description)

pal <- colorFactor("viridis", domain = c(1:7))

# Inspecting a collection

By yourself, go to an archive and choose a collection. For this collection, take notes on the following:

1. What genres of recordings/files are included?
1. What kinds of file types are included?
1. What type of access is allowed to the files?
1. What kind of metadata is provided at the item level?
1. What kind of metadata is provided at the collection level?

--

Here are some recommendations of collections to inspect:

- [Panare (ELAR)](https://www.elararchive.org/uncategorized/SO_57c13fe6-815c-4300-8916-816cb1310400/)

# Recording

A big part of 'digital methods' in fieldwork is the ability to record your data and use it at a later time!

--

This means we need to understand a few different issues to make our lives easier:
- Informed Consent

- Signal-to-Noise Ratio

- Tips for better recordings

- File naming

- File formats

---

# Informed Consent

In the EU, we are required to abide by the GDPR. This means we must be careful when dealing with personal data, which inevitably impacts how we go about data collection. Even anonymising counts as processing personal data. Unfortunately for us, recording audiovisual data is something we rarely anonymise.

???

As such, it is incredibly important to collect the explicit consent of those who you work with when applicable.

--

1. Informed consent can be oral or written, depending on what is most appropriate. 
1. All forms of taking informed consent should be done in clear and simple language.
1. Make sure to say how personal data will be processed and how long it will be stored for, as well as which purposes the personal data will and will not be used for.
1. Consent is not explicitly required under the GDPR for archiving or scientific research. However, it is ethically wrong to archive recordings of people without their consent.

---

# Signal-to-Noise Ratio

background-size: 80%

---

# Tips for better recordings

1. Have as little background noise as possible: turn off electrical equipment, use a windscreen/dead kitten, record when it is not so noisy, dampen potential echoes using blankets, and avoid creating extra noises when recording by e.g. typing or clicking a pen.

1. Monitor the recording through a pair of headphones throughout the recording or have a separate person fulfil this role.

1. Make sure your microphone is steady and will not move around. Consider using a tripod or mount if needed.

1. Adjust your microphone placement properly so that any unidirectional microphones are pointed (roughly) at the bottom lip of a speaker. This should avoid capturing pops created by plosives.

1. Aim to keep audio recording gain at around -12dB with a maximum -3~-6dB. Clipping occurs at 0dB.

---

# File Naming

How we name our files should be **FAIR**.

Things to keep in mind:
- filenames must be unique
- sessions should share the same filename
- filenaming for one data collection purpose may not be relevant for another purpose

# Best Practices

- Test your sound levels before starting and adjust them as needed.

- Always doublecheck you are recording before you start.

- Make a sharp, loud noise (e.g. a clap) in front of the microphone to indicate the start of a recording. This is incredibly helpful for syncing multiple audiovisual streams.

- Briefly list relevant metadata at the start of the recording (e.g., purpose of recording, who is recording, who will be speaking/signing, date of recording, location).

- Continue monitoring your sound quality throughout the recording.

- Prompt your speaker/signer, but do not interrupt them. You want to collect their data, not yours!

- Briefly summarise your session or get your speaker to do so before ending your recording.

- Fill out your metadata and backup and rename your files as soon as possible after sessions.
