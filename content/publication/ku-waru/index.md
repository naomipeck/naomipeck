abstract: Ku Waru is spoken by about 10,000 people in the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Trans New Guinea family of Papuan languages, and, more immediately, to a dialect continuum within the Chimbu-Wahgi branch. Ku Waru is a dialect of Mbo-Ung (ISO code mux). The Ku Waru corpus that has been deposited in ACQDIV is part of a much larger Ku Waru child language corpus that was recorded between 2004 and 2017, with the project headed by Alan Rumsey and Francesca Merlan. The larger corpus includes audio and video files. The portion included within ACQDIV (nine sessions) was recorded during 2013 and 2014, by Ku Waru field assistant Andrew Noma. (ACQDIV)
