# Leipzig-Jakarta Wordlist <br>(Haspelmath and Tadmor 2009)

You will be eliciting up to 40 words from your interviewee. They should say the word at least once in isolation, and once in a frame sentence. If you are using English as the contact language and German as the target language, you can use the frame sentence: *Ich habe ________ gesagt.*

See how far you get with the task in 8 minutes. Feel free to take notes during the "recording". At the end of the task, briefly summarise what happened (10 seconds or less) and thank the interviewee for their time.

Move to the next slide to see the words you need to elicit.

## Jackal and the Crow (Carroll, Kelly, and Gawne 2011)

The task consists of 9 images. The participant will tell a story based on the picture cards, which you will show one at a time. 

Suggested wording for instructions:

1. Individual card descriptions
*‘I have some pictures here that tell a story. I’m going to show you the pictures, one at a time, and I want you to tell me the story.'*

2. Retelling, if necessary
*‘Now we've seen all the pictures I would like you to tell me the whole story together.’*

When you are ready, move to the next slide and share your screen. Check that you are both able to be heard clearly. You may now "start" the "recording" by clapping and saying the basic metadata. Explain the task to the participant and move through the slides one at a time. If the participant has been unsure of the story until the end you may wish to ask them to retell it afterwards.

The task should take no more than 10 minutes. Feel free to take notes during the "recording". At the end of the task, briefly summarise what happened (10 seconds or less) and thank the interviewee for their time.

# The TMA Questionnaire (Dahl 1985)

This questionnaire provides 164 English sentences to translate in the studied language in order to elicit its TAM system (tenses, aspects and moods). You will be eliciting 15 sentences from this questionnaire (sentences 37-52).

For each sentence, prior context is provided in square brackets. Your interviewee should translate the sentence with MEET, with MEET conjugated appropriately in the target language. The words in the parentheses do not need to be translated.

Suggested wording for instructions:
*"I will ask you to translate some sentences for me. I will give you a short description of the context, before saying the sentence that should be translated into your language."*

Check that you are both able to be heard clearly. You may now "start" the "recording" by clapping and saying the basic metadata. Move through the slideshow to see the sentence prompts.

See how far you get in 10 minutes. Feel free to take notes during the "recording". At the end of the task, briefly summarise what happened (10 seconds or less) and thank the interviewee for their time.

# Pear Story (Chafe 1980)

The task is for the participant to watch a video. While they are watching, the participant should narrate the video out loud in a language they are comfortable in.

Suggested wording for instructions:
*‘I am about to show you a video that tells a story. I want you to tell me what's happening as you see it in the video.'*

When you are ready, move to the next slide and share your screen *with sound*. Check that you are both able to be heard clearly. You may now "start" the "recording" by clapping and saying the basic metadata. Explain the task to the participant and begin the video.

The task should take approximately 7 minutes. Feel free to take notes during the "recording". At the end of the task, briefly summarise what happened (10 seconds or less) and thank the interviewee for their time.
