My name is Naomi Peck and I originally hail from Melbourne, Australia. I currently live in Freiburg, where I do my PhD, but I have also previously lived and worked in Canberra (Australia), Seoul (South Korea) and Mainz (Germany). I also have done fieldwork in Roing and Anini (Arunachal Pradesh, India).

I have always loved the feeling you get when you solve a mental puzzle, and nothing has given me more satisfaction than chipping away at solving the puzzle that is Language.

I am a native English speaker and I also speak Korean and German at a high intermediate level. I have good passive knowledge of French and Japanese, but my active use of both is a bit rusty.
