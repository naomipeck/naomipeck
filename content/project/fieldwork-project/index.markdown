Collecting linguistic data from face-to-face interactions is becoming ever easier with modern technology. This workshop will introduce participants to the basics of fieldwork and data analysis in ELAN (ELAN 6.2 2021). On Day One, participants will be challenged to think about the nature of data and data collection, as well as the ethics and problems involved in the processes of fieldwork and archiving. They will then try out different methods of data collection with their fellow peers, such as paradigm elicitation, questionnaires, and picture and video tasks. On Day Two, participants will use one of their own recordings for further analysis in ELAN. They will be introduced to the concept of the “transcription bottleneck” and learn how to use ELAN in smart ways to segment, transcribe, translate, and annotate their data in less time. At the end of the workshop, participants will be given the chance to contribute their recordings and annotations to an archive for preservation.
