# What is data?

???

Himmelmann 2012 (see Further Sources) has a different categorisation of data (types), which may be more applicable for some of you. This is how I would categorise data types.

---

# Primary Data

Primary data is directly generated in the process of fieldwork. <br><br>

--

There are three main types of primary data: <br><br>

--

1. Introspective <br><br>

???

e.g. grammaticality judgment

--

2. Elicited <br><br>

???

e.g. direct translations; recordings

--

3. Observed

???

e.g. natural conversation; e.g. field notes

---

# Primary Data

These data differ according to different parameters: <br><br>

--

1. naturalistic vs. controlled <br><br>

--

2. spontaneous vs. elicited <br><br>

--

3. audiovisual vs. written

---

# Secondary Data

Secondary data involves a level of abstraction away from primary data sources. <br><br>

--

1. Annotations (of multiple levels and formats) <br><br>

--

2. Structural analyses (syntagmatic/paradigmatic)<br><br>

--

3. Lexical data (including dictionaries)

---

# Tertiary Data

Unsurprisingly, tertiary data involves another level of abstraction from secondary data.

---

# Tertiary Data

```{r, label="wals-map", out.width='100%', fig.height=6, echo=FALSE}

#str(df)
wals <- df[,c(2:6)]
#str(wals)
wals$value <- as.factor(wals$value)
wals$description <- as.factor(wals$description)

pal <- colorFactor("viridis", domain = c(1:7))

leaflet(data = wals) %>% addTiles() %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(~longitude, ~latitude,
    popup=~name, 
    label=~description, 
    color=~pal(value),
    stroke = FALSE,
    fillOpacity = 1
  )
```

# What kind of data do you want to collect? What is relevant for your research?

---

# Metadata

Metadata is data about the data you are collecting which will not necessarily become an object of your research. <br><br>

--

This could include the age and gender of who has been recorded, the location where the recording was made, or the role of a participant.<br><br>

--

This becomes very important in e.g. sociolinguistics, where demographic factors can become a relevant factor in explanation. And for those who are sociolinguists, this data is not metadata!<br><br>

--

It is also very important in interactional disciplines, where people regularly take into account situational factors in their explanation of phenomena. Whether an audience is present or not could radically influence how somebody acts.

---

# Metadata

More typical examples of metadata include:

- Identifiers of texts 

- Languages used

- Format of a file

- Description of a file

- Date of creation of a file

- Relations between files (i.e. video and audio belonging to the same recording session)

- Size of a file in bytes

- Equipment used to create a file (e.g. recording device)

# What kind of metadata should you collect for your research project?

# Data Collection

It is important that whatever data we collect in the field is usable for further analyses.

This requires taking care when collecting and processing data, which we'll go into further detail into when we make a Data Management Plan together.

--

<br><br>

Before we do more "meta"-planning, let's take a look at what kinds of things we need to think about before we embark on data collection.
