#About Me
My name is Naomi Peck and I originally hail from Melbourne, Australia. I currently live in Freiburg, where I do my PhD, but I have also previously lived and worked in Canberra, Seoul and Mainz. I also have done fieldwork in Roing and Anini, Arunachal Pradesh, India.

I have always loved the feeling you get when you solve a mental puzzle, and nothing has given me more satisfaction than chipping away at solving the puzzle that is Language.
