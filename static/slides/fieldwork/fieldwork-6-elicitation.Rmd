# Observer's Paradox

> #### ...the aim of linguistic research in the community must be to find out how people talk when they are not being systematically observed; yet we can only obtain these data by systematic observation. <br><br> (Labov 1972:209)

???

Labov, William. 1972. *Sociolinguistic Patterns*. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.

To get around the observer's paradox, aim to ask questions which prompt unreserved reactions or engage your consultants in the data collection process, so they become collaborators rather than 'lab rats'.

# Metadata

Metadata is data about the data you are collecting which will not necessarily become an object of your research. <br><br>

--

This could include the age and gender of who has been recorded, the location where the recording was made, or the role of a participant.<br><br>

--

This becomes very important in e.g. sociolinguistics, where demographic factors can become a relevant factor in explanation. And for those who are sociolinguists, this data is not metadata!<br><br>

--

It is also very important in interactional disciplines, where people regularly take into account situational factors in their explanation of phenomena. Whether an audience is present or not could radically influence how somebody acts.

# Metadata

More typical examples of metadata include:

- Identifiers of texts 

- Languages used

- Format of a file

- Description of a file

- Date of creation of a file

- Relations between files (i.e. video and audio belonging to the same recording session)

- Size of a file in bytes

- Equipment used to create a file (e.g. recording device)

# Tips for better recordings

1. Record for your future self listening back to the track, not for the you now!

1. Achieve the best signal (what you want to be heard) to noise (what you don't want to be heard) ratio as possible.

1. Turn off electrical equipment in the area which contributes to underlying noise.

1. Record in areas without wind and use a windscreen (sometimes called a "dead cat"!).

1. Record in areas which will not 'reflect' sound. You can dampen echoes by using lots of textiles!

1. Avoid creating extra noises when recording, such as typing or clicking a pen.

1. Monitor the recording through a pair of headphones throughout the recording or have a separate person fulfil this role.

# Tips for better recordings

1. Find better times to record if it is too noisy.

1. Use an external microphone: these provide much better quality audio than in-built microphones. 

1. The shorter the cord connecting the microphone to the recorder, the better.

1. Use an appropriate microphone. Unidirectional microphones (cardioid; shotgun) are good for capturing the audio of single speakers; omni- or bidirectional microphones are good for when multiple people are present.

1. Adjust your microphone placement properly so that any unidirectional microphones are pointed (roughly) at the bottom lip of a speaker. This should avoid capturing pops created by plosives.

1. Aim to keep audio recording gain at maximum -3~-6dB. A steady level of -12dB works well in my experience.
