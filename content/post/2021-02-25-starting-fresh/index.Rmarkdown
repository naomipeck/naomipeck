Making an academic site has been an item on my to-do list for a very long time, but it is only now - during a conference - that I find myself free enough to chip away at this task. It is also thanks to this conference that I finally found a suitable platform with enough flexibility that I can host both posts and publications, as well as keep it up-to-date with little-to-no effort (famous last words!).

Let me explain myself a little. The conference I am attending is the 43rd Annual Conference of the German Linguistic Society (DGfS), hosted by my home university. Thanks to the pandemic, I am sitting in front of my brand new work computer at home with a teapot of T2 chai. And here I am typing into a fresh .Rmarkdown file in between talks after being 'infected' (in the nicest sense) by the R bug following the R workshop run as the Doktorand Forum for DGfS this year by a couple of local [R-Ladies](https://twitter.com/rladiesfreiburg).

Learning to use R has been a real journey. I first started to code during my undergraduate degree at the first CoeDL summer school, where Evan Kidd taught us some basic statistics for psycholinguistic research. However, without a need to use it in my classes, I left this knowledge by the wayside. The second time I tried R was over a year later, when my boss Hedvig Skirg√•rd was learning R. She was keen to share this knowledge around, including to the students she was mentoring and even ended up teaching an introductory R course at a future CoeDL summer school herself with Siva Kalyan. My reason for not continuing to use R this time was very similar - without my own data and a real need to do data science, my motivation soon withered and RStudio was left to gather dust once more.

This is the third time that I have picked R up again, and it has been immensely rewarding to find so many different uses for the language in so many different areas of my research. I originally started using R again for [EMU-SDMS](https://ips-lmu.github.io/The-EMU-SDMS-Manual/), after being inspired by seeing it in work by [Amos Teo](amosbteo.com). I started using this to answer phonetics and phonology questions in my field data, although Praat still remains useful for a first look. I also started to properly learn data wrangling in order to run intercoder reliability tests for my study with Kirsten Culhane and Maria Vollmer on intonation unit boundary cues. And finally, I have made my site with the blogspot package following Alison Hill's [great instructions](https://alison.rbind.io/post/new-year-new-blogdown/), which was a lot easier than I had feared.

So, I now have myself a brand-spanking-new academic website. This will be a place where I will share my experiences, my thoughts, and my opinions on a wide range of topics in a friendly way and in a casual setting. It will be a sort of quasi-diary for my academic journey, however long it may last - and even longer past any sort of expiration date I may encounter. I hope that what I immortalise in this site - for everything is eternal on the Internet, one way or another - can be of help to at least one person confronted by some of the same problems, and I hope it can be of comfort to at least one person who needs it. 

To anyone who has made it to the end - congratulations on finding the first post and getting through what is a very clumsy attempt at putting my thoughts in a blog-style format for the first time in many a year. I do very hope you'll stick around.
