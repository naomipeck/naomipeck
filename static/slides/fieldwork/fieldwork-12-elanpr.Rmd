#ELAN time!

# Outcomes

By the end of this session, you should be able to:

- create new .eaf files
- turn on automatic backup
- create new tier types
- create new tiers
- create a template
- perform basic segmentation
- perform basic transcription
- add, change and delete annotations
- export from ELAN

---

# First of all

Do you have a recording?

If you didn't manage to make one, here are some back-ups which you can download: <!-- insert link -->

---

# Creating a new file

1. Open ELAN

1. Navigate to the folder in which your audio is in. Check it's named according to our DMP!

1. Select all media

1. Drag and drop them into ELAN <br>

# Save your new file

1. File > Save As/Ctrl + Shift + S

1. Save your file with a name according to our DMP!

???

Alternate (more traditional) way of creating a new file: 
1. Open ELAN
1. File > New
1. Browse to directory with data
1. Select all media (and templates, if applicable)
1. Click OK

---

# Turn on Automatic Backup

1. File > Automatic Backup

1. Choose how often your file should automatically save

<br><br>

Backups will have the file extension .eaf.001. To use them, rename the files to only have the extension .eaf.

---

# Getting used to the interface

Explore the interface! On your own, try to do the following:

1. Play your audio normally
1. Play just a selection of the audio
1. Make the selection loop
1. Scroll through the data file at light speed
1. Zoom into the audio file
1. Increase the size of the peaks of the audio file
1. Change the rate of the audio track
1. Change the volume of the audio track

```{r interface, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 10)
```

# Creating Tiers

---

class: middle

# What tiers do you need?

--

# How do these tiers relate to each other and to your audio file?

---

# Adding tier types

1. Create tier types for the following:

    -   transcription
    -   translation
    -   comment
    -   words
    -   gloss
    -   part of speech

1. Change the default tier to a reference tier by renaming.
    
```{r tier-types, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 10)
```

Generally, people use the following shorthand:
.pull-left[
- reference: ref
- transcription: tx
- translation: ft
- comment: ct
]
.pull-right[
- words: wd
- gloss (English): ge
- gloss (German): gd
- part of speech: ps
]

---

# Adding tiers

.center[
###datatype@participant
]

1. Create tiers for the following for one participant:

.pull-left[
-   reference
-   transcription
-   translation
-   comment
]

.pull-right[
-   words
-   gloss
-   part of speech
]


For transcription purposes, make sure that the *translation* tier is dependent on the *transcription* tier.

Once you are done, sort your tiers in the left-hand pane as you like. If you're done even earlier, adjust your settings in the main annotation section (e.g., increasing font size).

```{r tiers, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 10)
```

---

# Create a template

If you will be working on analysing multiple files, it saves a lot of time when you create a template. The template retains all of the tier types and tiers created in this file. You can use this template when you make a file (using the menu option) or you can import the tiers/tier types through the dialogue box.

Create a template for yourself now - your choice of name as we won't archive this!

# Segmentation

No-one’s first segmentation is ever exact.

The first time you segment is simply a first pass at the data. It’s alright if the segments don’t quite match the audio/video or if you need to combine two segments into one.

Editing the segmentation comes later.

# Basics

1. Add a new annotation

1. Change its timing

1. Change its value

1. Delete the annotation

1. Use shortcuts to "travel" through your existing annotations

```{r basics, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5)
```

# "Advanced" Annotation

1. Tokenise your translation tier to get separate words on your word tier

1. Generate automatic labels for your reference tier
