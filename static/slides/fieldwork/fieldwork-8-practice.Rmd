# Practicing Elicitation

We are now going to test out some of the techniques we explored in the last section in small groups.

Make sure you have a pen and paper with you, so you can practice taking notes.

---

# The Plan

In each group of three, you will run through three different elicitation exercises.

For each exercise, you will play one of three roles:

1. Interviewer

1. Interviewee

1. Recorder

--

Don't worry - you won't be recording! But it's good practice to get into the habit of what would happen during a 'live' session.

---

# The Interviewer

You will be responsible for running the session. 

---

# The Interviewee

You will be responsible for sharing your idiolect with your group!

---

# The Recorder

You will be responsible for "setting up" and monitoring the session.

To "set up" the recording, test that everyone has good gain levels and is seated comfortably.

At the start of a "recording", clap next to your microphone and detail the metadata for the session.

Monitor the session by making sure that the sound stays clear throughout, but let the interviewer take the reins. Keep an eye on the length of the session and let the interviewer know when to wrap up. Feel free to take notes during the "recording", noting down the timing of anything linguistically interesting.

At the end of the session, briefly summarise the session. Make sure to thank the interviewee for their time!

---

# Some notes

You are free to run your sessions in any language you wish, as long as you have a chance to try out all three roles and elicitation techniques.
