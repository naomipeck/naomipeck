abstract: |
 Bumthang (iso: kjz; glottocode: bumt1240) is an East Bodish language spoken in the central highlands of Bhutan, between Trongsain the western lowlands andUrain the east near Mongar. It is part ofthe Kurt√∂p-Bumthang-Khengkha continuum, and is itself split into multiple dialects with lexical, phonological and morphological differences that are very salient to native speakers (Donohue 2020). In addition to lexical and morphological differences between dialects, there are many phonetic and morphological differences between different varieties.
 This outline will focus on the phonology, since that is the area where we find the greatest divergence from other descriptions of East Bodish languages. The (too brief) discussion of tone in 3.4 the description can only be claimed to represent the variety spoken immediately north of the temple in Ura village; the south of the village, and the houses at the bottom of the valley to the east, near the school (approximately 100m away)have different tone systems which are salient markers of origin. Other villages in Ura valley, or just outside it, such as Shingnyer and Tangsibi (still judged to be part of the Ura dialect, on the basis of verbal morphology) are reported to be tonally even more distinct. A number of topics of particular interest are discussed in detail in the description of syntax.
