## Abstract
Posters are quickly becoming a fixture of academic conferences as organisers try to give more opportunities for academics to share their work. However, many often see a poster presentation as a poor alternative for a talk, rather than taking advantage of the opportunities given by print medium to transmit their message.

We will explore how we can best design a poster to communicate our research by discussing insights from the ‘Better Poster’ movement and graphic design, as well as learning about a few tools for creating a poster. Bring pen, paper, and your creativity with you!
