I am a PhD student of linguistics at Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg and member of the {{< staticref "https://www.linguistik.uni-freiburg.de/research/nongram" "newtab" >}}Emmy-Noether-Gruppe Non-Hierarchicality in Grammar (NonGram){{< /staticref >}}. I am currently researching how complex verbal constructions are realised by speakers in Northeast India for my dissertation.

I am fascinated by how we 'group' bits of languages together, whether this be how we construct noun phrases, chain verbs in serial verb constructions or clause chains, or chunk information together prosodically. My research aims to investigate the reasons why we group bits of languages together, whether this be cognitive, physiological, historical or something completely different.
