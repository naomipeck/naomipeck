# Hi!

.pull-left[
My name is Naomi Peck and I am a PhD student at the University of Freiburg, Germany.

I am writing my dissertation on the interaction of prosody and morphosyntactic structure in four languages of Northeast India.

Pre-COVID, I was planning to write a descriptive grammar of one of those languages, Kera'a. But things change!

# Hi!

I have previously conducted two trips to the field (Dibang Valley and Lower Dibang Valley, India) and worked with a consultant of a different language at my previous university for approximately 3 years. <br><br>

What you'll learn today *is not* the be all end all to fieldwork. Hopefully, however, it will get you started thinking about what you'll need to do in order to work with consultants and collect data, no matter whether this be in a different country or in the next village over.

# Goal

By the end of this workshop, we will have:

- collected a recording

- processed the recording, including metadata

- started the analysis of the recording

You will also have the option to further:
